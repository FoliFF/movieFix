This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling. Action fiction is related to other forms of fiction, including action films, action games and analogous media in other formats such as manga and anime. It includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action comedy, with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement."},"Director":{"Name":"Christopher Nolan","Bio":"Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed writer-director.","Birth":"1970-07-30"},"ImagePath":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/mediaviewer/rm4023877632/","Featured":true,"Actors":["Christian Bale","Heath Ledger","Aaron Eckhart"]}
